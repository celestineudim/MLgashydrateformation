Application of Machine Learning in predictive analysis of Gas-Hydrate Formation


Formation of Gashydrates in Natural gas lines means trouble because they deposit on the pipe walls and amass as large plugs, blocking pipelines and ultimately stopping production. The process of removing hydrates after they have formed in production and transmission lines could be expensive and time-consuming therefore, prevention of hydrate formation is a priority in order to maintain high capacity gas production. 
Experimental data obtained from a hydrate flow loop has been used to develope a machine learning model to predict hydrate formation and the behaviour of other dependent variables responsible for hydrate fromation.
